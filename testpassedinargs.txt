[A1] Hi please make sure 

{
  "age":10
}

is in the previous results box.

Currently age is set to: {$u:age}

[A2, displayif=valueOrDefault("age",-100) == 10 ]
If you see this question, displayif=valueOrDefault("age",-100) == 10) works

< -> Q2>

[A2_1, displayif=valueOrDefault("age",-100) != 10]
If you see this question, I'm quessing you did NOT set age to 10!
< -> Q2>

[A2_2] Houston, we have a problem w/the new functions.

[Q2, displayif=equals(age,10)  ] 

If you see this question, displayif=equals(age,10) works
< -> END >

[Q2_1, displayif=doesNotEqual(age,10)  ] 
If you see this question, I'm quessing you did NOT set age to 10!

[Q2_2] Houston, we have a problem with the old functions.
[END] all done. {$u:age}
